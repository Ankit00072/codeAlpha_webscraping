# 📚 CodeAlpha - Web Scraping Project

This project is part of my Data Analytics Internship at **CodeAlpha**.

Task 1: Web Scraping — Books from an E-commerce Test Site

In this project, I scraped book data including **Title**, **Price**, **Rating**, and **Availability** from a practice website designed for learning web scraping. The purpose of this task was to apply Python web scraping skills and build a clean, structured dataset for potential analysis and visualization.

 🌐 Website Targeted

🔗 http://books.toscrape.com/

This site is ideal for beginner-friendly scraping and mimics a real-world online bookstore.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- `requests` – to make HTTP requests
- `BeautifulSoup` – to parse and extract HTML elements
- `pandas` – to store data and export to a CSV file

📊 Extracted Data Fields

- **Title** of the book
- **Price** in GBP (£)
- **Availability** (In stock / Out of stock)
- **Star Rating** (One to Five)
